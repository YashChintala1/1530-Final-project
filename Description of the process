As I am the only one in the team, I implemented everything by myself.
The timelines are as follows:
1. April 11th was the first meeting(when I started working on the project) and came up with a plan to complete what when-Sprint 0
2. During the Sprint Planning phase, 
I evaluated the Product Backlog, selected 5 requirements that could be feasibly delivered, and broke them down into manageable tasks. Because of my sickness daily scrums were not possible, but I made it a point to work on them regurly and before the deadline.
